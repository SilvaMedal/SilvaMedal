### About
I come from a background of hospitality and restaurant management.  I'm a self-taught web developer with Full-stack experience and a Front-end focus.  I love challenging myself and learning new technologies.  Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, movies, board games, video games, and lawn games (bocce, cornhole, etc).
Currently, I'm part of the [CD Techies](https://github.com/CD-Squared-Tech) organization, a mixed group of senior developers and "new-to-tech" developers.
